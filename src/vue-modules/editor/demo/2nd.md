Q.1 There is no value of x that can simultaneously satisfy both the given     equations.Therefore, find the‘least squares error’ solution to the two  equations, i.e., find the value   of $$x$$ that minimizes the sum of squares of     the errors in the two equations.
  
$$$  2 * x^2  $$$

An ideal gas is adiabatically and irreversibly compressed from 3 bar and 300 K to 6 bar in a closed system. The work required for the irreversible compression is 1.5 times the work that is required for reversible compression from the same initial temperature and pressure to the same final pressure. The molar heat capacity of the gas at constant volume is $$30 \ J mol^{-1} K^{-1 }$$ (assumed to be independent of temperature); universal gas constant, R is  $$8.314 \ J mol^{-1} K^{-1 }$$; ratio of molar head
